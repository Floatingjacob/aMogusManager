# aMogusManager


I know there are already Among Us mod managers out there, but they either :


1. don't work
2. are annoying to use
3. too sketchy
4. are obselete 
5. don't have the features i need


So i decided to maky my own mod manager. like i said, there are lots of Among Us mod managers out there, so i named this "aMogusManager" because it is yet another mod manager.


Currently, this only supports Windows and Linux. I don't have plans for adding MacOS support (cus it sucks.)

Note: the paths for where Among Us is installed is currently hardcoded. i will probably make it so you can tell the program where Among Us is, but for now it's hardcoded.
This program expects Among Us to be installed at


"C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Among Us" for windows and


"~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Among Us" for linux.


Note: when you give the program the path to a mod's zip file, do not include the " marks.


This program will require you to authenticate with your Steam account to download new Among Us versions.
